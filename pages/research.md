## Thermodynamics and Structure of Confined Fluids

Prediction of the interaction of complex fluids (e.g. hydrogen-bonding fluids, hydrocarbons,
proteins, and polymers) with adsorbing surfaces is essential for the control of many processes of
current industrial and scientific interest. In our group, we develop tools in statistical
thermodynamics, equations of state, molecular simulations, and density functional theory to predict
the thermodynamic properties and structures of components confined near hydrophobic and hydrophilic
surfaces. These tools can be useful for solving problems in adsorption, shale gas reservoirs, and
other systems with confined fluids.

## Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Gas Hydrates

Gas hydrates are structures formed by the cooperative hydrogen bonding of water molecules to form
cages that encapsulate small molecules. In terms of methane reservoir, these crystalline structures
(clathrates) are extremely important because they trap enormous amounts of natural gas on the ocean
floor. The amount of carbon in gas hydrates is estimated to be more than twice the amount of carbon
in all other fossil fuel deposits. Gas hydrates have also been proposed as potentially useful in
novel gas separation processes and in transport of natural gas. In terms of problems, gas hydrates
can form in pipelines and, by agglomeration mechanism, can plug subsea pipelines from offshore
platforms causing economic loss and potentially unsafe conditions. For the flow assurance in oil and
gas industry and in collaboration with Petrobras, our group studies thermodynamic and kinetic
aspects related to hydrate formation and hydrate dissociation. Multiphase equilibria and kinetic
studies provide thermodynamic, transport, and kinetic data for hydrate decomposition.

## Asphaltene Precipitation and Deposition

The formation of asphaltene plugs in piping represent a significant problem in oil production and
refining. Asphaltenes are a collection of polydisperse molecules consisting mostly of polynuclear
aromatics with varying proportions of aliphatic and alicyclic and small amounts of heteroatoms
(oxygen, sulfur, vanadium, etc.). Problems in recovery and refining operations associated with
asphaltenes are due primarily to their molecular size and their self-aggregation. Hence, a better
understanding of asphaltene phase behavior and deposition requires a better understanding of how
molecular size and aggregation affect phase behavior and deposition. For the flow assurance in oil
and gas industry our group, in collaboration with Petrobras, we study thermodynamics and kinetics
aspect related to asphaltene precipitation, deposition and agglomeration using both CPA type of
equation of state and molecular simulation.

## Wax Precipitation

During production, petroleum is submitted to different temperature and pressure conditions, which 
can lead to precipitation of different solids, such as hydrates, asphaltenes and waxes. Among these 
flow assurance issues, wax deposition gains importance as the frontiers of oil exploration moves 
towards hostile environments, like deep water and the Artic. Wax deposition is hard to remediate, 
as it depends on mechanical removal of the deposits through pigging operations or chemical intervention 
like solvent soaking. As these different operations lead to production loss, the most cost effective 
strategy to deal with wax deposition is to avoid it during the design of production installations. 
Thus, the use of thermodynamic models for the calculation of solid-liquid equilibria (SLE) for mixtures 
of waxes and oil is very important to the petroleum industry. Therefore, our group studies, in 
collaboration with Petrobras, the thermodynamic aspects related to wax precipitation using 
different approaches available in the literature.

## Structure-Property Relations of Complex Materials

Our research focuses on the study of materials and their applications by means of microscopic-scale
modeling and computer simulation. In this way, we try to understand how the molecular constitution
of a material determines its observed thermophysical properties. An exciting possibility is the
study of yet undiscovered materials, entailing the prediction of their properties and the search
for novel applications. This is the core of the discipline known as Material Design.
The computational methods we employ in our investigations include advanced Monte Carlo (MC) methods
such as Configurational-Bias MC, Multihistogram Reweighting, Multicanonical and other Non-Boltzmann
Sampling methods, Transition-Matrix MC, and so on. Not only have we applied known methods, but also
developed new ones and assembled many of them under a useful, generalized framework. For instance,
we have being studying the equilibrium adsorption of polymers on solids with heterogeneous
distributions of active sites, the effects of molecular topology on the scaling behavior and phase
transitions of complex polymers, and the interaction between proteins and electrically charged
surfaces of existing nanodevices.
