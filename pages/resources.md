# Infrastructure

## Cluster Computing

**Gibbs** is the name given of a computer cluster available to all ATOMS members. At this time, it
possesses 296 Central Processing Units (CPU's) and 16 General-Purpose Graphical Processing Units
(GP-GPU's), which are mostly used for molecular simulations.

## HPF

First generation of the HPF equilibrium cell. It is used to observe phase transitions.

## Photochemical Reactor

Reactor used for photoreduction of aromatic molecules.
